.SH NAME
startlxqt \- script to initialize and launch LXQt sessions
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B startlxqt
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBstartlxqt\fR is a shell script meant to initialize and launch LXQt sessions.
It is as such similar to counterparts of other desktop environments like startlxde in
LXDE or startxfce in XFCE.
.P
Its main tasks are exporting environment variables, partly after performing
corresponding checks, and launching \fBlxqt-session\fR, the LXQt session manager.
.P
It is not meant to be run by users.
Rather, it is invoked as backend, e. g. by script \fBstartx\fR on virtual terminals or
display managers like SDDM or LightDM, see section \fIEXAMPLE\fR.
.SH FILES
.I $XDG_DATA_DIRS/xsessions/lxqt.desktop
.RS 5
Desktop entry file stating startlxqt as binary needed to start LXQt sessions. Sourced e. g.
by display managers.
.RE
.SH BUGS
None at the time of this writing. Bugs can be reported on
https://github.com/lxqt/lxqt-session/issues.
.SH EXAMPLE
To start an LXQt session from a virtual terminal (virtual console) add a line
.P
.RS 5
exec startlxqt
.RE
.P
to file \fI~/.xinitrc\fR. An LXQt session will then be launched by running \fBstartx\fR.
.P
Display managers are making use of scripts like \fBstartlxqt\fR automatically. Information
about available desktop environments is provided by files \fI$XDG_DATA_DIRS/xsessions/*.desktop\fR,
typically \fI/usr/share/xessions/*.desktop\fR.
.br
File \fIlxqt.desktop\fR provided by LXQt is stating \fBstartlxqt\fR in key \fIExec\fR while
making sure the session manager \fBlxqt-session\fR does exist by stating it in key \fITryExec\fR.
