# Example autostart file for a labwc LXQt session
# Applications started here won't be closed by `lxqt-leave --logout` and settings can be lost
# Preferred place for starting wayland-only applications

# Set background color or image (below the desktop)):
swaybg -i /usr/share/lxqt/wallpapers/origami-dark-labwc.png  >/dev/null 2>&1 &

# Faster startup for GTK apps:
dbus-update-activation-environment --systemd DISPLAY WAYLAND_DISPLAY > /dev/null 2>&1 &

# Configure output directives such as mode, position, scale and transform.
# Use wlr-randr to get your output names
# Example ~/.config/kanshi/config below:
#   profile {
#     output HDMI-A-1 position 1366,0
#     output eDP-1 position 0,0
#   }
# kanshi >/dev/null 2>&1 &
# wdisplays can be used as well on the fly

#
# Note that in the context of idle system power management, it is *NOT* a good
# idea to turn off displays by 'disabling outputs' for example by
# `wlr-randr --output <whatever> --off` because this re-arranges views
# (since a837fef). Instead use a wlr-output-power-management client such as
# https://git.sr.ht/~leon_plickat/wlopm
#
# Suspending can be configured in LXQt power management settings
# Screen locking can be configured in Session Settings
# Turn off display(s) after 5 minutes
swayidle -w timeout 300 "wlopm --off \*" resume "wlopm --on \*" > /dev/null 2>1 &
